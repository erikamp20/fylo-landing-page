## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot from doing this project. In the first place, I was able to create my own custom properties, and I made different components to make things easier to structure. I put into practice my knowledge of Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design. It was a bit harder to implement the responsive design, but it helped me a lot. üòÅ
